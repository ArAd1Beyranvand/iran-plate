/// The blocks that go in a Bahraini plate's [PlateSpec.panel].
///
/// **Every constant here has `code: 'bh'`, so they all compare equal.** That is
/// the same contract the other country packages in this workspace keep: the
/// code identifies the country, and the rest of the value is how that country's
/// block is printed on one class of plate. A host that wants to know which
/// block it is holding asks the spec, not the code.
///
/// Bahrain uses its country block in two quite different ways, which is why
/// there are two shapes of value here rather than one with a colour argument:
///
/// - **Civilian plates** ([civilian]) print no coloured block at all. The flag
///   sits directly on the white field, so the panel is the flag's rectangle and
///   [PlateCountry.panelColor] is the field colour — a block that is there,
///   holds the flag, and cannot be seen. The words `البحرين` / `BAHRAIN` are
///   set at their own spot on the face as [PlateLabel]s, not as a caption, so
///   the two scripts can sit apart from each other instead of stacking against
///   the flag.
/// - **Special plates** ([diplomatic], [police]) print a coloured band across
///   the head of the plate and no flag. There the panel is that band: a colour
///   and nothing else, with the wording again placed as labels so each script
///   lands where the real plate puts it.
///
/// So neither shape uses [PlateCountry.captionLines]. A caption is one
/// left-aligned column stacked under the flag, and no Bahraini plate sets its
/// wording that way.
