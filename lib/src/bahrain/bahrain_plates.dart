/// The Bahraini plate designs.
///
/// Five specs, and between them exactly three ideas:
///
/// 1. **A grey vertical security band.** Every Bahraini plate carries one. On
///    the American size it stands clear of the right frame with the wording
///    outboard of it; on the European, bicycle, diplomatic and police plates it
///    runs the full height hard against the right edge. It is a [PlateRule], so
///    core paints it in [PlateTheme.dividerColor] — which is why no Bahraini
///    theme is a [PlateTheme.monochrome]; see `BahrainThemes`.
/// 2. **A flag, or a coloured band, in [PlateSpec.panel] — never both.**
///    Civilian plates put the flag on the white field, so the panel is the
///    flag's own rectangle painted in the field colour. Diplomatic and police
///    plates print a colour across the head and no flag, so the panel is that
///    band. Both are [BahrainCountry] values; neither uses a caption.
/// 3. **Wording as [PlateLabel]s.** `البحرين` and its Latin partner sit at
///    opposite ends of the plate on every design, which a caption — one
///    left-aligned column under the flag — cannot express. Labels on the
///    coloured bands carry their own [PlateLabel.color], because the band's ink
///    is not the serial's.
///
/// `final`, not `const`: the serials are built by [plateRegister], and a
/// `const` constructor cannot run a loop. Initialised lazily, once per isolate;
/// [PlateSpec] equality is over `id` alone, so nothing here depended on const
/// canonicalisation.
///
/// Every coordinate below is sampled by eye from plate photographs and is a
/// calibration target.
